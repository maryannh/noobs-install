# Installing Raspbian using Apple OS X El Capitan

## Preparing the SD Card

If you have a fresh SD Card then the following steps may not be necessary, but they won't do any harm if you are unsure.

1. Start *Spotlight* by either clicking on the magnifying glass in the top right hand corner of the screen or by tapping the *Command Key* and *Space* on your keyboard.

2. Type *Disk Utility* into the search bar.

3. Choose the *Disk Utility* program which should be the the top hit.

4. In the *Disk Utility* program, the available disks should be listed in the left-hand panel. Select it, and check that the *Capacity* matches the SD card that you inserted.

## Copying over the files.

1. OS X automatically extracts downloaded zip files, so in your Downloads folder you should see a folder titled *NOOBS* with some version numbers after it.

2. Open up a new *Finder* window and navigate to the SD Card. It is best to position the two windows side by side.
